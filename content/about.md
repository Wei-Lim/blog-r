## About Hugo

Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and
configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website. With its
amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

[Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/).
